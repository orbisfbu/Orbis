# Pitch

### Helping you be a larger part of your favorite events. Pitch includes the best features currently available from the best event apps, such as creating and exploring events near you and filtering them based on your preferences. Unlike all the other event apps out there, Pitch is built from the ground up with the notion that you should be a larger part of the events you attend. That is why, for example, we have included the ability to view the current queue of music playing at an event and allow you to add suggestions. Based on how popular your song suggestion is (through a democratic voting system) your song will move up or down the queue.
